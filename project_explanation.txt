                    AI TUTOR ORCHESTRATOR - PROJECT EXPLANATION
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
================
The AI Tutor Orchestrator is an intelligent middleware system designed to bridge the gap 
between conversational AI tutors and multiple educational tools. It acts as a central 
coordination hub that understands natural language requests from students and automatically 
orchestrates the appropriate educational tools to fulfill those requests.

CORE PROBLEM SOLVED
===================
Traditional educational systems require students to manually navigate between different 
tools and platforms, leading to fragmented learning experiences. The AI Tutor Orchestrator 
solves this by:

1. Understanding conversational context and determining necessary educational tools
2. Intelligently extracting parameters from natural conversation
3. Validating and formatting requests for proper tool execution
4. Handling diverse tool schemas across 80+ different educational functionalities
5. Maintaining conversation state and student personalization context
